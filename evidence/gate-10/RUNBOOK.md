# Dusk Library Runbook
## Gate 10 - Incident Management

### Incident 1: Discord API Gateway Unreachable / 5xx Loops
**Trigger:** Your bot logs are filled with `HTTP 502 Bad Gateway` or `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` escaping from `await Client.request(...)`.
**Severity:** Critical
**Resolution:**
1. Check the official [Discord Status](https://discordstatus.com/).
2. The library `Dusk` has native Cro::HTTP retries. If the error escapes, it means the API has been entirely offline for repeated checks.
3. Stop the bot supervisor (`systemctl stop bot` or `docker stop`).
4. Wait for Discord to announce recovery before rebooting, as aggressive hammering while they are down might trigger permanent Token bans.

### Incident 2: Token Revoked / 401 Unauthorized
**Trigger:** `HTTP Error: 401` crashes the application.
**Severity:** Critical
**Resolution:**
1. The token inside `.env` (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`) has been leaked or forcefully regenerated by the owner on the Discord Application Dashboard.
2. Go to `https://discord.com/developers/applications`, select the Bot, and click "Reset Token".
3. Update `.env` with the new Token.
4. Restart the bot.

### Incident 3: Type Check Failures / Model Deserialization Crashing
**Trigger:** `Type Check failed in binding to...`
**Severity:** High
**Resolution:**
1. Discord has likely released an undocumented v10 API change (e.g., changing a property from `Str` to `Int` or adding a new constraint).
2. Look at the stack trace to determine which `Dusk::Model::*` object caused the crash.
3. Fork `Dusk`, adjust the `.rakumod` file by relaxing the Type Constraint (`Any`) or applying an explicit type coercion logic (`.Int`).
4. Re-run `prove6 -l t/` to verify it fixes the issue.
5. Deploy the hotfix.
